    This example will not seem very useful, as for the sake of simplicity and understandablity, I made the minimal application, that doesn't make sense. This snippet will make sense, however in some more complicated instances.
    <br> press F12 in windows or make whatever weird thing you need to do in mac computers, to open the developer console.

  <script src="on.js"></script>
  <script>
  console.log("click in the document");
  //imagine we are making some sort of javascript library
  var testob=(function(){
    //I make this just to get the "this" within a listener callback
    var parent=this;
    //whoever calls the onHandlers, gets the handling functionality
    onHandlers.call(this);
    document.addEventListener("click",function(){
      //by doing this single line, the testob effectively has a "clik" listener.
      parent.handle("clik");
    });
    this.do=function(){
      //by doing this single line, the testob effectively has a "doing" listener.
      this.handle("doing");
    }
    return this;
  })();
  //now we create the callback for the listeners.
  testob.on("doing",function(){
    console.log("testob is doing!");
  });
  testob.on("clik",function(){
    console.log("testob is handling a click.... let's make it do()");
    testob.do();
  });
